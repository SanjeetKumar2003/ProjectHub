  - You are about to drop the column `type` on the `Account` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `updatedAt` on the `Account` table. All the data in the column will be lost.

  - The required column `id` was added to the `Session` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
  - Made the column `email` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
